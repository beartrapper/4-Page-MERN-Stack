Looking for a sample website using MEAN stack. 
- Features: 1.

- login+signup 2.

- landing page: link for 2 countries section with 
  list of areas under each country
  (I just need 2 countries & 2 areas under it) 
  3. once you click the area link,
  3rd page will show 2 category 
  section with category title (e.g. category1, category2), 
  and under each category 2 
  links to click (e.g. wanted1, wanted2)

 - 4. Once you click the link wanted1/2, a page will be shown, with some description, and contact.
  and a button for email to contact. If you press email to contact,
   it will open a page for email, and send email. Just these 4 pages only.
    Very simple. I just need a framework, don't waste time to improve look & feel too much, 
    I just need the functionalities. technology: Mean - angularJS latest version & mongoDB.
